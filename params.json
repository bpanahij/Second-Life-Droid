{"name":"Second-life-droid","body":"### Welcome to Second Life Droid\r\nThis bundle of scripts functions together as an autonomous battle robot (droid) in Second Life. Your just have to put it together into a set of primitives and the scripts will seek out and begin to communicate with one another via messaging. Each script needs it's own prim and the weapons scripts will generate projectile prims, so they should probably go in som sort of gun-like prim.\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Purpose\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out the documentation at http://help.github.com/pages or contact support@github.com and we’ll help you sort it out.","tagline":"An Autonomous Droid Program written is Linden Scripting Language","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
